# Job Analysis Dashboard

The development of a Job Market Analysis Dashboard addresses critical challenges in understanding and responding to the complexities of the contemporary job market. By providing a centralized, real-time, and holistic view of employment dynamics, this tool has the potential to revolutionize decision-making processes for individuals, businesses, and policymakers, contributing to a more resilient, adaptive, and inclusive workforce ecosystem.

Real time scaraping of data was done using python and further data processing was done to fine tune it present on the dashboard.

### Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML,CSS,JavaScript for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Backend: Flask for server-side logic and data processing.
Database: SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.
Data Analytics: Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly for in-depth data analysis and Visualisations.
